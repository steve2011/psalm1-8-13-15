    1 Blessed is the one
        who does not walk in step with the wicked
    or stand in the way that sinners take
        or sit in the company of mockers,
    2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
        and who meditates on his law day and night.
    3 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
        which yields its fruit in season
    and whose leaf does not wither—
        whatever they do prospers.

    6 For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
